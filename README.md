Power-On Reset Circuit Implementation Using Open Access EDA Tools
Project overview 
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Power-On Reset (POR) circuit utilizing open access EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools. The primary objective is to create a robust POR circuit that ensures reliable initialization of digital systems upon power-up. This implementation aims to leverage freely available EDA tools to design, simulate, and verify the functionality of the reset circuit. By using open-source software. Detailed design files, simulation results, and documentation are included to guide users through the process of replicating and understanding the circuit's operation.
